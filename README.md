# Text Scrambler

This is translation of my Java-based (TextScrambler program)[https://github.com/maxgreen01/TextScrambler] into a JavaScript-powered website. For more information on the inspiration behind this project, check out the original project!

## Demo Usage

To run the program, use `npm i` to install all project dependencies, then run `npm start` to host the webpage locally at `localhost:8080`! To access the program itself, visit `localhost:8080` in any web browser while the HTTP server is still running!
